Frontend:
- show years played on player cards
- change search cards to only show names and years played
- add in message for incorrect guess
Backend:
- fix backend to update from past update date to current date
- possibly use NHL API to feed into DB instead of web scraping (or look at not using a DB at all??? idk might be stupid)
    - https://api-web.nhle.com/v1/season can get all year IDs
    - https://api.nhle.com/stats/rest/ping to ping the server (might be useful to not waste time with errors if/when its down)
    - https://api.nhle.com/stats/rest/en/game gets every game played ever (NEED TO VERIFY IF IT INCLUDES PRE/POSTSEASON)
        - looks like it literally includes EVERY game, including all star games
        - I think I should allow for regular season and post season games
            - these are gameType = 2 and gameType = 3
    - https://api-web.nhle.com/v1/gamecenter/{gameId}/boxscore gets the boxscore of a game (use to get players on each team)
        - think about whether or not goalies without TOI should count
    - https://assets.nhle.com/mugs/nhl/{yearCode}/{teamCode}/{playerId}.png to get player headshot for a certain year and team
- idea: create new DB using NHL API
    - first check DB, get all game IDs, and only get gamecenter report for those not already in DB
    - create entry in DB for the game and each player with team
