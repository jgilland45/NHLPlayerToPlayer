Frontend:
- show years played on player cards
- change search cards to only show names and years played
- add in message for incorrect guess
Backend:
- fix backend to update from past update date to current date
- possibly use NHL API to feed into DB instead of web scraping (or look at not using a DB at all??? idk might be stupid)
    - https://api-web.nhle.com/v1/season can get all year IDs
    - https://api.nhle.com/stats/rest/ping to ping the server (might be useful to not waste time with errors if/when its down)
    - https://api.nhle.com/stats/rest/en/game gets every game played ever (NEED TO VERIFY IF IT INCLUDES PRE/POSTSEASON)
        - looks like it literally includes EVERY game, including all star games
        - I think I should allow for regular season and post season games
            - these are gameType = 2 and gameType = 3
    - https://api-web.nhle.com/v1/gamecenter/{gameId}/boxscore gets the boxscore of a game (use to get players on each team)
        - think about whether or not goalies without TOI should count
    - https://assets.nhle.com/mugs/nhl/{yearCode}/{teamCode}/{playerId}.png to get player headshot for a certain year and team
    - https://api-web.nhle.com/v1/player/{playerId}/landing
        - gives all the data I think I'll ever need for a player
    - https://search.d3.nhle.com/api/v1/search/player?culture=en-us&limit=100000&q={query}
        - eg. use 'connor%20mcdavid to find the one I'm looking for
- idea: create new DB using NHL API
    - first check DB, get all game IDs, and only get gamecenter report for those not already in DB
    - create entry in DB for the game and each player with team
    - have two tables:
        - playerId as primary key, with gameIdw/Team array storing the game ID with team abbr at end
        - gameIdw/Team as primary key, with playerId array
    - TODO:
        - add in (gameIdw/Team as primary key, with playerId array) table
            - might not need?
        - try playing with DB data in JS
            - create a union-find structure to find all teammate links in NHL history

- new plan 12/29/2024
    - check that all of the players in Player_Info that have played NHL games have their correct names
    - for test_game
        - make options for what kind of games to include (just reg or playoff, or any type of game)
        - make easy way to customize parts of the game (valid teams, valid years, # and kinds of powerups, etc)
        - add in actual timer
        - add in fuzzy search for player names (possibly leave this for GUI app)

- todo 04/30/2025
    - create backend to run the brains of the different games
        - could use rust? or just python would work to (use what is in `test_game.py`)
    - use sockets to connect client to server
    - current issues
        - need to hook up front-end components (team links, incorrect guess, game over screen)
        - instead of getting players through the client from the db directly, maybe get the player list from the server?
        - look into making socket-like connections, rather than having client polling server
        - fix `any` typing issues
